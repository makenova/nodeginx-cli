# Nodeginx CLI

A CLI helper for managing [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) virtual
host configs and the `nginx` process. This assumes you are using the
sites-available and sites-enabled setup, where those directories are arranged as
so,

```
/etc
|-- nginx
     |-- nginx.config
     |-- sites-enabled
     |    |-- site-one
     |    +-- site-two
     +-- sites-available
          |-- site-two
```

server blocks are setup in the sites-available directory and are "turned on"
by creating a symbolic link to the sites-enabled directory. In the example
above, site-one and site-two are setup but only site-two is served by nginx.

## Installation

This is an [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) package, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
is a prerequisite.

```
$ npm install --g nodeginx-cli
```

## Use

Type `nodeginx` on the command line, your sites should be listed, and you
will be prompted. The nginx config files are usually in a directory that
requires root permission. You may be prompted for you password if your user is
not set up for pasword-less sudo (not tested).
